In a parent Documents folder go to folder Figures.


To create a finite state diagram:

  edit a file, say fig8, using 
    state
    arc
  commands as detailed in ChartToMP


------>  can do like
                       figure fig8

      (figure is a batch file that runs ChartToMP and then mpost)

  jcr ChartToMP fig8 proof
      (proof to see the control points, leave off for final version)
    [creates fig8.mp]

  mpost fig8
     (does metapost on fig8.mp to produce fig8.1, a postscript file)

  In a TeX document sitting in the parent folder for Figures, do

  \fig{8}{fig8.1}
      [or for more freedom, \epsfbox{fig8.1},
       must select Typeset as TeX and DVI rather than pdftex]


You can edit fig8.mp to manually add or remove things, but
if do this, rename fig8 to fig8orig and put in Safe, so that
we don't forget and do ChartToMP again on fig8, destroying fig8.mp
with the laborious changes.


The center-to-center arc command puts the label for the arc
to the left of the arrow.

To place the label elsewhere, hand-compute the midpoint and use
one control point, giving ability to place the label wherever desired
relative to the control point.
   Or, just edit fig8.mp and change the label offset.

Label offsets are:

  ulft top urt
  lft      rt
  llft bot lrt
